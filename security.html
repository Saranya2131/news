<h2 align="center"><b>PYTHON SECURITY TIPS</b></h2>
<p class="p1">
<b>1. Input Validation and Sanitization:</b><br>
Always validate and sanitize all external data, including user inputs, API responses, and file uploads, to prevent injection 
attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Avoid using eval(), exec(), or os.system() with untrusted input due to 
inherent security risks.<br><br>

<b>2. Dependency Management:</b><br>
Keep Python and all installed libraries updated to the latest stable versions to benefit from security patches.
Use tools like pip-audit or safety to scan for known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. 
Minimize the number of dependencies to reduce the potential attack surface.<br><br>

<b>3. Secure Handling of Secrets:</b><br>
Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or cryptographic keys directly in your code.
Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management tools for storing and retrieving secrets securely.<br><br>

<b>4. Authentication and Authorization:</b><br>
Implement strong authentication mechanisms and robust authorization controls to ensure only authorized users and processes 
can access sensitive resources. Use secure libraries for password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, argon2-cffi) and secure
session management (e.g., Flask-Login).<br><br>

<b>5. Secure File Operations:</b><br>
When handling file uploads, validate file types (using MIME types, not just extensions), sanitize filenames, 
and store uploads outside the application's root directory. Implement size limits for uploaded files to prevent 
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.<br><br>

<b>6. Error Handling and Logging:</b><br>
Implement proper error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages to users.
Log detailed errors internally for debugging. Be mindful of what information is logged to prevent 
inadvertently exposing secrets.<br><br>

<b>7. Secure Transmission and Encryption:</b><br>
Use secure protocols like HTTPS for data transmission over networks.Encrypt sensitive data at rest using
libraries like cryptography when storing it.<br><br>

<b>8. Code Security Analysis:</b><br>
Regularly perform static analysis of your code using tools like Bandit to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
Conduct code reviews to catch security flaws early in the development cycle.<br><br>

<b>9. Least Privilege Principle:</b><br>
Grant the minimum necessary permissions to users and processes to perform their intended functions, limiting potential
damage in case of a breach.<br><br>

<b>10. Virtual Environments:</b><br>
Use virtual environments (e.g., venv, pipenv) to isolate project dependencies and prevent conflicts or security issues 
from affecting other projects or the system's global Python installation.<br><br>
